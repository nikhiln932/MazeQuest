# MazeQuest

MazeQuest is a web-based puzzle and adventure game built using **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java**.  
Inspired by classic 1980s-style gameplay, MazeQuest challenges players to navigate complex dungeons filled with puzzles, enemies, and hidden treasures â€” all through a modern, web-friendly backend.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

In MazeQuest, players control a character who explores a series of mazes and dungeons, solving challenges and completing objectives to progress.  
These objectives can include escaping mazes, defeating enemies, activating switches, and collecting valuable items.

The backend system is implemented in **Java** using OOP design patterns, providing a modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture for future expansions and enhancements.
